The radial function for r>rMT can be expressed as a linear combination of the two linearly independent solutions of the Schrödinger equation when the potential is constant and equal to zero.

THE THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

The model is very sensitive to small variations in Rc. The reason can be seen in the following feature: fc not only acts as a cut-off function but also defines the attractive branch of V2 (since 
�
2
=
0
) and the radial components of V3.

The SW potential has been applied in the description of systems with covalent bonds in connection with clusters, lattice dynamics, bulk point defects, etc. 
The potential has been applied to several materials:
Si, Ge, sulfur, fluorine and to the Si-F system

describes a stationary state in which a free particle has a definite momentum p (and energy E = p2/2m). Let us now consider stationary states of a free particle in which it has a definite value, not only of the energy, but also of the absolute value and component of the angular momentum. Instead of the energy, it is convenient to introduce the wave number

The wave function of a state with angular momentum l and projection thereof m has the form

(equation (32.8) with U (r) ≡ 0). The wave functions ψklm for the continuous (with respect to k) spectrum satisfy the conditions of normalization and orthogonality:

.
The orthogonality for different l, l′ and m, m′ is ensured by the angular functions. The radial functions must be normalized by the condition

If we normalize the wave functions, not on the “k/2π scale”, but on the “energy scale”, i.e. by the condition

then, by the general formula (5.14), we have

For l = 0, equation (33.3) can be written

To solve equation (33.3) with l ≠ 0, we make the substitution

For χkl we have the equation

If we differentiate this equation with respect to r, we obtain

By the substitution

 it becomes

which is in fact the equation satisfied by χk, l+1. Thus the successive functions χkl are related by

and hence

where χk0 = Rk0 is determined by formula (33.6) (this expression can, of course, be multiplied by an arbitrary constant).

Thus we finally have the following expression for the radial functions in the free motion of a particle:
